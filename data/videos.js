		Properties are the laws of math that state that a mathematician must follow these rules [the properties] to solve a math problem. Every math subject, such as Geometry and Algebra, follow these properties. A math that doesn't follow, for example, with the commutative property in: {\displaystyle a}a • {\displaystyle b}b = {\displaystyle b}b • {\displaystyle a}a is not, in simple terms, math. However, it is a rule, a math rule but it's called a property because math follows it. Thus, it is essential for every mathematician to, not only memorize, but apply these properties as well.`,

		description: `Definitions: A quadratic equation is a second-order polynomial equation in a single variable x ax2+bx+c=0. with a ≠ 0 . Because it is a second-order polynomial equation, the fundamental theorem of algebra guarantees that it has at least one solution. The solution may be real or complex.`,

		description: `Factoring Quadratics. Factoring quadratics is a method of expressing the polynomial as a product of its linear factors. It is a process that allows us to simplify quadratic expressions, find their roots and solve equations. A quadratic polynomial is of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers.`,
